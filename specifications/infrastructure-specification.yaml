# *** Labels for syntactic components ***
# Children do not have to be specified if parent is not defined
# If no label is given, then context will determine label (Everything should be labeled eventually)
#
# REQUIRED      These must be defined. Not doing so is an parse-time error
# Suggested     These should be defined. Will give a warning during parsing
# Optional      Do not have to be specified
# Option X      One of the options specified at that level must be defined. Not doing so is a parse-time error
